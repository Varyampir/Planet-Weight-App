Planet-Weight-App
=================

DGM3790 - Group Mobile Application Proposal - Solar System App
 
For our group mobile application, we will be building an interactive app that will give users information about our solar system. It will provide an interactive and educational experience for children and adults.
The app will allow users to input their age, date of birth, and weight, and will tell them what their age would be, when their next birthday would be, and how much they would weigh on each of the planets in the solar system. It would also provide the following data on each planet:
Planet Name
Distance from Sun
Rotation period
Revolution period
What you would be called on that planet (Martian, Mercurian, etc)

 All of the data will be stored in a database and will be accessed asynchronously in JSON format. We also plan to explore the possibility of finding an API with up-to-date information about the planets in the solar system, and integrating that data into the app as well. We would also like to implement the Facebook API to allow users to share what they have learned with their friends.
